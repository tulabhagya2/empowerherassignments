# AI-Powered Responsive Personal Portfolio Website
  
The objective is to build a fully responsive personal portfolio website using **HTML + CSS only**, and generate the initial template using an **AI website builder tool**.

---

## 🚀 AI Tool Used
**Lovable AI Website Builder**

The initial layout and design were generated using Lovable.  
After that, the HTML and CSS were copied into VS Code and manually improved as required.

## 🔧 Manual Improvements Done
After generating the template using the AI tool, I manually edited and improved the code in VS Code:

- Added proper external CSS linking  
- Cleaned the HTML structure  
- Improved responsiveness using media queries (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
- Created hamburger/stack navigation for mobile view  
- Adjusted 2-column grid for tablet and 1-column grid for mobile  
- Applied a unique and consistent color theme  
- Added simple CSS-only animations  
- Added hover effects for skill cards  
- Ensured there is no horizontal scroll on any device  
- Organized files into `index.html` and `style.css` only (no frameworks)
